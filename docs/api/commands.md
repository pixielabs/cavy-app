Available with cavy-cli.

* [See installation instructions](../getting-started/installing)
* [View on GitHub](https://github.com/pixielabs/cavy-cli)

## Reference

### `cavy init`

```bash
cavy init [<specFolderName>]
```

Set up testing with Cavy within your React Native project. Creates a `specs`
folder with an example spec in it, and an `index.test.js` file, from which Cavy
will boot your app and run your specs.

* `<specFolderName>`: The directory in which you'd like to keep your
spec files. Defaults to `specs`.

---

### `cavy run-ios`

```bash
cavy run-ios [options] [rn-options]
```

Run tests on iOS.

`options`:
* `-f, --file <file>`: Specify the app entry point. By default, Cavy
looks for an `index.js`.
* `-s, --skipbuild`: Start the test server and listen for results without first
building the app. Assumes your app is already running.
* `-d, --dev`: Start the test server and keep it running until manually killed.
For use with hot-reloading.

`rn-options:`
* Any [react-native-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-cli) options that are valid for `react-native run-ios`.

#### Examples

Set `index.ios.js` as the entry point:

```bash
cavy run-ios -f index.ios.js
```

Set a custom entry point and specify a device (see [React Native: Running On
Simulator](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/running-on-simulator-ios)):
```bash
cavy run-ios -f index.ios.js --simulator="iPhone 4s"
```

Run Cavy tests in dev mode having built and started your app independently:

```bash
cavy run-ios -d -s
```

#### Note
If you choose not to skip the build, then Cavy CLI will build and run your app
using `react-native run-ios` under the hood.

### `cavy run-android`

```bash
cavy run-android [options] [rn-options]
```

Run tests on Android.

Options are the same as for `cavy run-ios`.
